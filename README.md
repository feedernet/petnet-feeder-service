Reverse-engineering the PetNet feeders. This project only works with V2 Feeders so far.

## Setup / Installation

Head over to the [Getting Started Wiki](https://github.com/petnet-independence-project/petnet-feeder-service/wiki/Getting-Started) for more information on spinning up your first FeederNet instance.


## Developing

You need to make sure the Python modules are available.

```
pip install poetry
poetry install
```

To run the daemon locally:

```
poetry run python -m feeder
```

If you are planning on solely developing for the backend, you can build a static version of the frontend and access the backend directly:

```
cd static
PUBLIC_URL=/build npm run build
```

Otherwise, in a different shell, run the Webpack development server:

```
npm start
```

### Linting and Code Formatting
We use Black formatting for Python and Prettier for JS, JSON, etc.

Tox will automatically run both of these tools when it runs it's normal test suite. 
If either step fails, you will need to rerun the respective formatter.

#### Black
```shell
black --target-version py38 feeder/ tests/
```

#### Prettier
```shell
cd static
npx prettier --check ./src
```

## Database and Schema Migrations

This project uses SQLAlchemy and Alembic for managing database models and schema migrations.

If you change a database model and need to generate a migration, Alembic can do that for you automatically!

```shell script
DATABASE_PATH=./data.db alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Changing something about the models."
```

This will create a migration script in `feeder/database/alembic/versions`.

To apply these changes to your database, run:

```shell script
DATABASE_PATH=./data.db alembic upgrade head
```
